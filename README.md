# water-dashboard
Spreadsheet created for the Kweekvallei Water Users Association of [Prince Albert](https://princealbert.org.za/). Takes in measurements of dam levels in metres and flow levels for various water sources, and outputs a summary table as below. Involved the use of VBA. Unfortunately not LibreOffice compliant as uses structured references which Calc does not support.
